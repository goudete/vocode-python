## Overview

To handle inbound calls, you have to set up an inbound number and then configure vocode to handle the call.

## Setting up inbound number
1. Create a [Twilio](https://www.twilio.com/) account
2. Once inside your dashboard, go to Phone Numbers -> Manage -> Buy a number to get a phone number.
3. Then, go to Phone Numbers -> Manage -> Active Numbers and select the number you want to set up.
4. Update the config to point the Webhook URL to `https://<YOUR BASE URL>/inbound_call` - if you're using `ngrok`, it looks like `https://asdf1234.ngrok.app/inbound_call`

5. Hit **Save**

## Configure vocode
Then, you configure a `TelephonyServer` with one or more `InboundCallConfig` objects.

These objects specify:

- The URL endpoint for the inbound call
- The agent configuration - this controls the conversational agent that will handle the call
- Optional transcriber and synthesizer configurations
- Provider specific configuration - e.g. Twilio or Vonage credentials

When an inbound call comes in, vocode will:

- Answer the call
- Create a conversation ID to track the call session
- Spin up a conversational agent based on the `InboundCallConfig`
- Connect the call to the agent via a WebSocket
- Handle transcribing audio from the caller and synthesizing responses back
- Persist transcripts and other metadata

After the call ends, vocode tears down all resources for that conversation.

## Configuring Twilio

To handle inbound calls from Twilio, use the `TwilioInboundCallConfig`.

This requires passing in your Twilio credentials and configuring the URL endpoint Twilio should send calls to.

For example:

```python
from vocode.models.telephony import TwilioInboundCallConfig

inbound_config = TwilioInboundCallConfig(
  url="/inbound_calls",
  twilio_config=TwilioConfig(
     account_sid="ACxxx",
     auth_token="abc123"
  ),
  agent_config=MyAgentConfig()
)
```

## Configuring Vonage

For Vonage, use the `VonageInboundCallConfig` and provide your Vonage API credentials:

```python
from vocode.models.telephony import VonageInboundCallConfig

inbound_config = VonageInboundCallConfig(
  url="/inbound_calls",
  vonage_config=VonageConfig(
     api_key="xxx",
     api_secret="yyy",
     application_id="zzz".
     private_key="www"
  ),
  agent_config=MyAgentConfig()
)
```

## Customizing Agents

The `agent_config` parameter on the inbound call configs controls the conversational agent.

You can customize this to:

- Change the base prompt the agent receives 
- Configure different agent backends like ChatGPT
- Set up advanced dialog managers

See the [Agents documentation](/open-source/agent) for more details.

## Accessing Transcripts

vocode persists transcripts for each call session.

You can access these programmatically by listening for `RecordingEvent` events on the `EventsManager`.

The event payload contains the transcript URL to fetch.
